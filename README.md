# Election Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning models to predict election outcomes in Texas's Congressional District 32. It includes two models:
1. **Regression + Classification Model**: For basic predictions.
2. **XGBoost Regression + Classification Model**: For enhanced accuracy and handling of imbalanced data.

## Features
- Predicts voter turnout, vote percentages, and winning candidates.
- Uses population, demographic, and historical election data for predictions.
- Visualizations for better insights into the data.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muzamil06/Election-Prediction.git
cd Project/Pro
2. Install Required Libraries
Install all the necessary Python libraries using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Models
Use the following commands to run the models:

For the Regression + Classification Model:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py
For the XGBoost Regression + Classification Model:

bash
Copy code
python xg_prediction.py
File Structure
requirements.txt: Contains all the required Python libraries.
predict.py: Runs the basic regression + classification model.
xg_prediction.py: Runs the XGBoost-enhanced regression + classification model.
data_preparation.py: Prepares and cleans the data for modeling.
visualization.py: Generates visualizations like maps and charts.
main_pipeline.py: Integrates all steps from data preparation to prediction.
Notes
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
Place the datasets in the appropriate folder if required (refer to data_preparation.py for dataset paths).
For issues, check the library versions in requirements.txt or update your Python environment.
